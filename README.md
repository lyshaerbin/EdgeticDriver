# EdgeticDriver
Applications of rapidly advancing sequencing technology exacerbate the need to interpret the functions of genetic variants. It has been increasingly appreciated that genetic mutations could have a subtle effect on protein function or network rewiring, contributing to diverse phenotypic consequences across cancer types. However, no computational method is available to identify such ‘edgetic’ mutations in cancer. Here, we developed EdgeticDriver as an open-source tool to identify the candidate driver mutations that perturbed the functional pathways in cancer. Applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified the perturbed functional profiles can discriminate cancer and normal samples at a higher accuracy, which was validated in independent dataset. In addition, we identified the candidate driver mutations that perturbed the functional network. Compared with other commonly used computational methods, EdgeticDriver increases the accuracy to retrieve cancer-related genes. We anticipate EdgeticDriver will facilitate improved biological understanding of the function of cancer variants towards personalized precision medicine.
